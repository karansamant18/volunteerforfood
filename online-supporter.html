  <h3>Sometimes even though we feel for a cause and want to be a part of the solution, our day to day work holds us back. At the end of the day we convince ourselves saying ‘I would have done my bit if I had time’.

    We believe that if we have the passion for the cause and the spark within, we can make a child smile without disturbing our daily operations. Sign in as a Cyber Advocate for The Akshaya Patra Foundation and all you have to do is:-

      <br>
      <br>
      1. Forward the mailers to your friends and help us spread the word across.<br><br>

      2. Promote Akshaya Patra in your social networking profile and ask your friends to follow us.<br><br>

      3. Introduce Akshaya Patra to all your online communities/ fan clubs etc.<br><br>
